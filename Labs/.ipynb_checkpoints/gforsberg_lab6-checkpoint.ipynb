    "### Instructions\n",
    "0. Remember to comment.  If your code fails to perform the task at hand but your comments are describing proper code execution I can award a substanial amount of points for logical errors in your program.  Think of comments as the equivalent of showing your work in a math class.\n",
    "1. Read all instructions carefully, ask questions if anything is confusing.  \n",
    "2. Fill in the code/text blocks to answer each question.\n",
    "3. Do **not** change any of the existing code provided.  The code is specifically there to help you!\n",
    "4. Run the entire notebook *before* submitting it on Sakai to make sure that the code actually runs without errors.\n",
    "5. **Important**: Any question for which your code fails to run will receive 0 points.\n",
    "6. Have fun!\n",
    "7. DO NOT USE ANY PACKAGES, other than the ones I have imported.  Part of learning is to struggle through the \"hard way\" before getting to do things the easy way.  Any packages I have imported are fair game and you may use any functions unless otherwise specified.  If I've imported them after a function, I've deliberately made it so you cannot retroactively use them in an earlier problem.\n",
    "8. If I've used return(None) for a function, you may definitely change the return type.  It's just a placeholder\n",
    "9. While you may discuss the concepts of the problems with your peers your code will need to be yours and yours alone.\n",
    "10. Replace CS497 with your BUID (ie if I was turning in this assignment my file would be called dbrennan_lab6FA19).  \n",
    "11. Do not zip your lab file with the output txt, I do no want your generated txt (I will make it myself!), but please attach your downloaded txt without zipping"

    "You are going to build this function and translate a document you have downloaded.  I've handled all the file processing, splitting the words out of the text.  You merely need to take in a word (string input) and return a word (string output) having shifted some things around.  My code is designed to give your function a word, it will handle the spacing/punctuation/etc.\n",

    "Words of length 4 are when the fun begins, you'll need to preserve the first and last letter.  Choose two random middle letters and swap them.  It's pretty easy to pick a word where this could fail, choose any palindrome like racecar.  The r's are excluded from selection but it's certainly plausible the a's switch places.  For the sake of simplicity if the letters are identical and get swapped, we'll put a \"\\\\\" (the single slash) in front of the first letter to denote it's been swapped.  This shows me that you understand the algorithm in addition to giving a clear and demonstratable handling of swapping the same letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "So \"racecar\" with the a's both being randomly selected turns into \"r\\acecar\".  It becoems a little less readable, but it alerts me that you've swapped the characters appropriately.  \n",

    "Despite the example clearly moving the apostrophe, don't worry about anything other than the two letters switching.  Your life will be made easier just handling the swap of two characters.\n"
