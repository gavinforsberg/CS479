    "### Instructions\n",
    "0. Remember to comment.  If your code fails to perform the task at hand but your comments are describing proper code execution I can award a substanial amount of points for logical errors in your program.  Think of comments as the equivalent of showing your work in a math class.\n",
    "1. Read all instructions carefully, ask questions if anything is confusing.  \n",
    "2. Fill in the code/text blocks to answer each question.\n",
    "3. Do **not** change any of the existing code provided.  The code is specifically there to help you!\n",
    "4. Run the entire notebook *before* submitting it on Sakai to make sure that the code actually runs without errors.\n",
    "5. **Important**: Any question for which your code fails to run will receive 0 points.\n",
    "6. Have fun!\n",
    "7. DO NOT USE ANY PACKAGES, other than the ones I have imported.  Part of learning is to struggle through the \"hard way\" before getting to do things the easy way.  Any packages I have imported are fair game and you may use any functions unless otherwise specified.  If I've imported them after a function, I've deliberately made it so you cannot retroactively use them in an earlier problem.\n",
    "8. If I've used return(None) for a function, you may definitely change the return type.  It's just a placeholder\n",
    "9. While you may discuss the concepts of the problems with your peers your code will need to be yours and yours alone.\n",
    "10. Replace CS497 with your BUID (ie if I was turning in this assignment my file would be called dbrennan_Lab519FA).  "
