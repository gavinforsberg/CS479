    "1. Read all instructions carefully, ask questions if anything is confusing.  \n",
    "2. Fill in the code/text blocks to answer each question.\n",
    "3. Do *not* change any of the existing code provided.  The code is specifically there to help you!\n",
    "4. Run the entire notebook *before* submitting it on Sakai to make sure that the code actually runs without errors.\n",
    "5. **Important**: Any question for which your code fails to run will receive 0 points.\n",
    "6. Have fun!\n",
    "7. Extra credit (if applicable) will only be granted if this lab is turned in before the end of class\n",
    "8. **Do not import any packages!**  Any packages available to you are designed to be used from their import statement down.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  Problem 1 doesn't have any import statements.  Problem 2 imports one package called \"A\".  Problem 3 imports one package called \"B\".  You may not use \"A\" or \"B\" for problem 1, you may not use \"B\" for problem 2 and you may use both for problem 3.  If you were to restart and rerun all cells in your notebook you would not be able to use a package prior to importing it so it logically makes sense as well!"
